# Graph-Theory-Project
## Description
Program in Python to execute regular expressions on strings using an algorithm known as Thompson’s construction.This program can build a non-deterministic ﬁnite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression, and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text.
## Implementation
* Shunting yard algorithm to convert a regular expression from infix to postfix.
* Create NFA's for each fragment in the regular expression.
* Macth the infix with a string.
## Running the project
1. Git clone the repository.
2. Change the directory to the project root folder
3. Run the program using "python3 Project.py".
